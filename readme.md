# 15112 Term Project (Title TBA)
## A space for all your music, all your stats, all for you and you only
### Problem:
 If you're like me, you listen to music in a *lot* of places, whether
 locally stored or on some web streaming service. And you wish that there
 was *some* way to track your listening habits across all these services
 without being paywalled. Luckily, a solution arose-- last.fm
 
 Oh wait, you need external services to track local scrobbles with that.
 *And* you get paywalled when you try to see your stats from a week ago.
 To be honest, the appeals aren't worth the cost. However, they walked
 so this app could run.
